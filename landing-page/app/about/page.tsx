            <p className="text-xl text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">
              I've been in business for over <strong className="text-light">40 years</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              During that time, I've sold professionally, led sales teams, trained salespeople, coached effectiveness, and grown businesses I owned. My sales education came through hands-on experience and formal training with <strong className="text-teal">Xerox Selling Systems</strong>, <strong className="text-teal">Dale Carnegie Training</strong>, <strong className="text-teal">Sandler Selling System</strong>, and <strong className="text-teal">Challenger Sales</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light leading-relaxed mb-2">I didn't just learn these systems.</p>
            <p className="text-light leading-relaxed mb-2">I sold with them.</p>
            <p className="text-light leading-relaxed mb-2">I trained others to use them.</p>
            <p className="text-light leading-relaxed mb-8">And I was accountable for the results.</p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Over time, I noticed a pattern that never went away.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl text-light leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Sales training worked — <strong className="text-pink">until pressure showed up</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Reps left training confident and aligned. Early behavior improved. Then quotas tightened, time compressed, and rejection accumulated. Under pressure, people didn't rise to their training — they <strong className="text-light">reverted to their strongest habit</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-2">Not because they didn't care.</p>
            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-2">Not because the methodology was wrong.</p>
            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">But because training alone doesn't create permanent behavior change.</p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">
              As an International Sales Manager, and later as a business owner, I saw how costly this drift was. Coaching arrived too late. Feedback came after the deal. Performance varied when it mattered most.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              That's when a paradox became clear to me:
            </p>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-teal pl-6 py-4 my-8 bg-navy-light/30 rounded-r-lg">
              <p className="text-xl text-light italic leading-relaxed">
                The moment salespeople need training the most<br />
                is the moment they can access it the least.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">
              So my focus shifted.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I stopped asking how to train better and started asking how to <strong className="text-teal">make the right behavior automatic — even under pressure</strong>. Because hope isn't a strategy, motivation isn't a system, and delayed feedback is expensive.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light leading-relaxed mb-2">What I learned was simple:</p>
            <p className="text-xl text-teal leading-relaxed mb-8">
              when behavior becomes habit, results become predictable.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">
              If permanent habit change could be created, a meaningful lift in sales performance would follow — not through hype or heroics, but through structure, visibility, and timely reinforcement.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">
              That thinking is what led to <strong className="text-gold">The Revenue Factory</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">
              It reflects how I've always worked: measure what matters, reinforce execution before drift occurs, and coach while the moment is still alive.
            </p>

            <p className="text-light leading-relaxed mb-2">Because sales performance doesn't change in hindsight.</p>
            <p className="text-light leading-relaxed mb-2">It changes in execution.</p>
            <p className="text-xl text-teal font-semibold leading-relaxed">It changes when it matters.</p>
