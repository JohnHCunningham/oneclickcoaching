## Repo
- **Local:** `/Users/johncunningham/oneclickcoaching`
- **GitHub:** `JohnHCunningham/oneclickcoaching`

- **Deploy:** Vercel (needs `oneclickcoaching.com` domain pointed to it)

## Build Status
`npm run build` passes cleanly. **40 routes** compile successfully.

## What's Been Built (Code Complete)

### Infrastructure
1. **White-label foundation** — Migration 056 adds branding fields to Accounts table. BrandProvider React context injects CSS vars. Sidebar shows custom logo/company name.
2. **RAG Knowledge Base** — `Sandler_Knowledge_Base` table (migration 034) with pgvector embeddings. `rag-search` edge function with semantic search. `scripts/seed-knowledge-base.ts` ready to run — seeds all 8 Sandler components, objection handling, best practices with OpenAI embeddings.
3. **Daily Cron Pipeline** — Migration 059 creates pg_cron jobs at 8am EST Mon-Fri. Chains: hubspot-sync → fathom-sync → aircall-sync → analyze-call → notify leaders. Includes `Pipeline_Runs` tracking table.
4. **Non-Repetition Engine** — Migration 058 creates Coaching_Suggestions_Log table. GPT-4 is instructed to not repeat prior suggestions per rep. Escalates recurring weaknesses.

### Frontend Pages (All Compiled)
1. **Radial KPI Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — Leader view: 5 radial circles, team members table, recent coaching, needs attention alerts. Rep view: personal scores, Sandler breakdown, benchmarks.
2. **Planning & Benchmarks** (`/planning`) — Migration 057 creates Benchmarks table. Leader sets targets per rep or team-wide. Radial progress circles.
3. **Coaching Page** (`/coaching`) — Pending/Sent/Replies tabs. Leader edits and approves before sending.
4. **Settings Page** (`/settings`) — Account name, logo, colors, email from-name.
5. **Team Page** (`/team`) — Team roster, invite modal with role selection, member profiles.
6. **Celebrations Page** (`/celebrations`) — Badges, wins feed, 5 badge types.
7. **Calls Page** (`/calls`, `/calls/[callId]`) — Call history with Sandler scores, individual call analysis.
8. **Integrations Page** (`/integrations`) — HubSpot, Fathom, and Aircall with connect/disconnect/sync UI.
9. **Landing Page** (`/`) — Trimmed, clean marketing page.
10. **Blog** (`/blog`) — Markdown-based, 9 posts.

### Edge Functions (All Complete)
- `analyze-call` — GPT-4o structured Sandler analysis with RAG, fallback to keyword scoring
- `hubspot-sync` — OAuth-based sync of calls, emails, meetings, tasks
- `fathom-sync` — API key-based sync of video call transcripts
- `aircall-sync` — Basic Auth sync of phone call recordings
- `send-coaching-email` — Resend-based email with HTML template, reply tokens
- `coaching-reply` — Handle email replies to coaching
- `rag-search` — Semantic search, scripts-for-weakness, coaching-context modes
- `generate-embedding` — On-demand embedding generation
- `hubspot-oauth-callback` / `fathom-oauth-callback` — OAuth flow handlers

### Migrations (Written, Not Yet Applied to Production)

- `057_planning_benchmarks.sql`
- `058_coaching_suggestions_log.sql`
- `059_daily_cron.sql`

## What Still Needs To Be Done

### Deploy Steps (Manual / Ops)
- [ ] Point `oneclickcoaching.com` DNS to Vercel
- [ ] Set env vars in Vercel: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- [ ] Enable `pg_cron` and `pg_net` extensions in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Set database settings for cron: `ALTER DATABASE postgres SET app.supabase_url = '...'` and `app.service_role_key = '...'`
- [ ] Run migrations 056-059: `supabase db push`
- [ ] Deploy edge functions: `supabase functions deploy --all`
- [ ] Configure Resend API key: `supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=...`
- [ ] Run knowledge base seeder: `SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=... npx ts-node scripts/seed-knowledge-base.ts`
- [ ] Seed demo data or connect live HubSpot/Fathom/Aircall
- [ ] Git push to trigger Vercel deploy

### Testing After Deploy
- [ ] Test email delivery end-to-end (Resend)
- [ ] Verify coaching-reply endpoint works for rep responses
- [ ] Test Aircall sync with Aircall API sandbox
- [ ] Verify RAG search returns relevant results after seeding
- [ ] Test daily cron fires correctly at 8am EST

### Nice-to-Have (Post-Launch)
- [ ] Cron schedule override in settings UI
- [ ] Stripe billing integration
- [ ] Notification preferences per user
- [ ] Logo file upload (currently URL-based)

## Business Context
- Target: Sandler consultants who resell to their sales teams
- Pricing: $50/rep/month (your wholesale price, consultant marks up)
- Leader approves all coaching before it goes to reps
- 8am Mon-Fri cron: sync → analyze → queue coaching → notify leader
- White-label: consultant can use their own logo/colors
- Key value: deep Sandler methodology analysis that doesn't repeat itself
