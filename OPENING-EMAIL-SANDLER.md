## **Subject Line Options:**

**Subject:** Quick question about your team's Sandler execution

Hi [First Name],

I know I'm catching you cold, so I'll be brief.

I help sales leaders at [Industry - e.g., housing providers, SaaS companies] solve a specific problem:

**Their reps know Sandler methodology, but they're not executing it in real conversations.**

The result? Sandler-trained teams that still:
- Feature-dump instead of using the Pain Funnel
- Skip Up-Front Contracts
- Talk 60% of the call instead of 30%

I built an AI-powered coaching system that analyzes EVERY sales call and gives reps **specific Sandler scripts** to use next time—not generic feedback like "build more rapport."

**Example:** When a prospect says "We're too busy," instead of ending the call, the system coaches:

> *"Try: 'I get it. And that's exactly why I called—to potentially give you back 20 hours a week. If I could show you how in 15 minutes, would that be worth it?'"*

**Just curious:** Do you have a system to coach every call your team makes, or are you limited to 2-3 calls per week per rep?

If you don't, would it make sense to spend 15 minutes exploring whether this could help [Company] hit quota more consistently?

Worst case, we'll both know it's not a fit.

Fair enough?

P.S. - I've attached a one-pager showing exactly how it works. If you're curious, you can also see a live demo of your own call being analyzed with Sandler coaching: [Calendar Link]

## **Follow-Up Sequence (If No Response)**

---

### **Day 3 Follow-Up**

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your team's Sandler execution

[First Name],

Not sure if you saw my note below about AI-powered Sandler coaching.

I'll keep this simple:

**If I could show you a way to give your reps tactical Sandler scripts after EVERY call (not just the ones you listen to), would that be worth 15 minutes?**

If yes → [Calendar Link]
If no → Just reply "not interested" and I'll stop bothering you.

Best,
John

### **Day 7 - Breakup Email**

**Subject:** Closing the loop - [Company]

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm going to assume one of three things:

1. **Not a priority right now** (totally fair - timing is everything)
2. **You already have a system** to coach every sales call with Sandler methodology (if so, I'd love to hear about it!)
3. **My emails aren't getting through** or you're slammed and this fell through the cracks

If it's #1 or #2, no worries—I'll stop here.

If it's #3 and you're curious about how AI can scale Sandler coaching without hiring more managers, just reply "curious" and I'll send you a 2-minute demo video.

Either way, thanks for your time.

Best,

## **Alternative Opening (More Direct)**

---

**Subject:** [First Name] - I think your Sandler training is being wasted

Hi [First Name],

That's probably a bold subject line, but hear me out.

Most sales leaders invest in Sandler training (or already have Sandler-trained reps), but here's what happens:

- **Week 1:** Reps are fired up, taking notes
- **Week 4:** They're using 30% of what they learned
- **Week 12:** Back to old habits—feature dumping, skipping Pain Funnel, talking 60% of the call

The problem isn't the training. It's **reinforcement**.

I built an AI system that listens to every call and gives reps **specific Sandler scripts** for next time.

Example: When a prospect says "Send me some information," instead of just sending it, the AI coaches:

> *"Try: 'Happy to. Just so I don't waste your time, after you review it, what happens next? Are we scheduling a follow-up, or will you reach out if interested?'"*

**Question:** Would it be worth 15 minutes to see how this could help [Company] actually execute the Sandler methodology you've already invested in?

If yes, grab 15 minutes here: [Calendar Link]
If no, just reply "not a fit" and I won't follow up.

## **When to Use Each Approach**

**Template 1 (Softer):** Use for cold prospects, referrals, or when you don't know their Sandler background
**Template 2 (Bolder):** Use for companies you KNOW have Sandler training (LinkedIn, job postings mention it, etc.)

---

## **Key Principles (All Templates)**

✅ **Negative Reverse Selling** - "I'm not sure if this is a fit"
✅ **Up-Front Contract** - "Would it make sense to spend 15 minutes..."
✅ **Pain-Focused** - Lead with their problem, not your features
✅ **Respect Their Time** - "I know I'm catching you cold, so I'll be brief"
✅ **Remove Pressure** - "Worst case, we'll both know it's not a fit"

---

## **Personalization Checklist**

Before sending, customize:
- [ ] **[First Name]** - Use their actual name
- [ ] **[Company]** - Mention their company by name
- [ ] **[Industry]** - Reference their specific industry (housing, SaaS, manufacturing, etc.)
- [ ] **Pain Point** - Tailor to their specific challenge if known
- [ ] **Calendar Link** - Make sure it's working and goes to YOUR calendar
- [ ] **Phone/Contact** - Add your actual contact info

---

## **Success Metrics**

Track:
- **Open Rate:** Target 40-50% (good subject lines)
- **Response Rate:** Target 5-10% (qualified prospects)
- **Meeting Booked Rate:** Target 2-3% of sends

If you're below these, test:
1. Different subject lines
2. Shorter emails (try 50% shorter)
3. Different CTAs ("Reply 'curious'" vs. "Book a call")

**Good luck! 🚀**
