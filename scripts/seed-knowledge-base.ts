WRONG Response: "We're better than Fathom" or "We can do everything Fathom does"

RIGHT Response: "I'm not competing with Fathom. I'm making Fathom more valuable for Sandler clients."

Full breakdown:
1. Acknowledge: "You're right - I can't compete with Fathom on video infrastructure. That's not what I'm building."

2. Reframe: Think of it like:
- Fathom = X-ray machine (billions to build, works for everyone)
- My product = Radiologist (specialized interpretation, personalized treatment)

3. The difference:
- Fathom's AI: Generic prompts → generic summaries
- My AI: Sandler-specific prompts → Sandler coaching (scores Upfront Contract, Pain Funnel, etc.)

4. Why Fathom won't compete: They serve everyone - HR, support, sales. If they optimize for Sandler, MEDDIC users complain. You can specialize because you ONLY serve Sandler clients.`,

Response: "I'm the ANTI-tool. I make the tools you already paid for more valuable."

Key points:
- Zero additional work for reps
- Integration layer, not another standalone tool
- Reps keep using Fathom/HubSpot/Aircall
- They just receive better coaching from data those tools already capture

What happens WITHOUT your product:
1. Make call on Zoom/Aircall
2. Manually log call in CRM
3. Type notes
4. Wait for Friday 1:1
5. Generic coaching

What happens WITH your product:
1. Make call (same as before)
2. Everything else happens automatically
3. Wake up to specific coaching in email`,

Response: "You're right - great coaching requires human judgment. That's why managers approve every AI-generated message. I'm not replacing coaching. I'm making coaching SCALABLE."

The Time Math:
Current state (10 reps):
- 10 reps × 30-minute 1:1 = 5 hours/week
- Prep time (listen to calls, notes) = 3-4 hours
- Total: 8-9 hours/week on coaching

With AI coaching:
- AI analyzes all calls overnight = 0 minutes
- Manager reviews 10 coaching drafts = 30 minutes
- Edits and sends = 15 minutes
- Total: 45 minutes/week

That's 8 hours back per week = 416 hours/year.

The Hybrid Approach:
- Daily AI coaching: Tactical, specific, immediate
- Weekly 1:1s: Strategic, relationship, career development

Use AI for tactical coaching (scales to 100 reps). Use human for strategic coaching (doesn't scale).`,

Response: "Let me show you why it's actually too cheap."

ROI Calculation:
What you pay: $299/user/month × 10 reps = $36K/year

What you get:
1. Manager time savings: 8 hours/week × $60/hour × 52 weeks = $24,960/year
2. Performance improvement: 10% improvement × $50K/rep × 10 reps = $50,000/year
3. Training ROI preservation: $50K training stays at 80% vs 20% = $30,000/year
4. Avoid ONE turnover: $80,000/year saved

Total value: $184,960/year minimum
Your ROI: 5.1x

Compare to alternatives:
- Do nothing: 80% training forgotten, $150K+ lost revenue
- Hire full-time coach: $130K/year, can only coach 8-10 reps
- My product: $3,588/year per rep, scales infinitely

I'm 72% cheaper than a human coach and scale infinitely.`,

Response: "That's why we track everything. Let me show you how we prove ROI."

The Measurement System:
Before: Baseline metrics, Sandler scores, manager coaching hours
During: Read rate, acknowledgment rate, behavioral change, performance change
After 90 days: Performance delta, time saved, ROI calculation

The Accountability Loop:
1. AI generates coaching (automatic)
2. Manager reviews and sends (human approval)
3. Rep receives notification (email + in-app)
4. System tracks when rep reads it (timestamp)
5. Rep can acknowledge or ask questions (engagement)
6. Manager sees if rep read it (accountability)

90-Day Performance Guarantee:
If after 90 days you can't measure improvement, full refund. No questions asked.

You'll KNOW if it's working within 30 days. Zero risk to you.`,

Response: "I understand. But let me show you what waiting costs."

The Cost of Delay (per month):
- Lost manager time: 32 hours × $60 = $1,920
- Lost performance: 5% underperformance × $500K quota × 10 reps = $25,000
- Training drift: Effectiveness drops 10% per month

Total cost of waiting 3 months: $80K-100K
Cost to start today: $9K for 3 months

The question isn't 'Should we do this?' The question is 'Can we afford NOT to?'

3. Pain Funnel (25% weight - highest!)

   - Emotional impact uncovered
   - Pain quantified in dollars/time

4. Budget Step (15% weight)
   - Money discussed before solution
   - Budget range explored
   - Investment connected to pain

5. Decision Step (15% weight)
   - Decision makers identified
   - Process and timeline mapped
   - Competitors uncovered

6. Fulfillment (10% weight)
   - Features tied to stated pain
   - No feature dumping
   - Checked for understanding

7. Post-Sell (5% weight)
   - Buyer's remorse addressed
   - Clear next steps with dates

8. No Free Consulting (5% weight)
