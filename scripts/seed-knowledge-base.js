RIGHT Response: "I'm not competing with Fathom. I'm making Fathom more valuable for Sandler clients."

Full breakdown:
1. Acknowledge: "You're right - I can't compete with Fathom on video infrastructure. That's not what I'm building."

2. Reframe: Think of it like:
- Fathom = X-ray machine (billions to build, works for everyone)
- My product = Radiologist (specialized interpretation, personalized treatment)

3. The difference:
- Fathom's AI: Generic prompts → generic summaries
- My AI: Sandler-specific prompts → Sandler coaching (scores Upfront Contract, Pain Funnel, etc.)

4. Why Fathom won't compete: They serve everyone - HR, support, sales. If they optimize for Sandler, MEDDIC users complain. You can specialize because you ONLY serve Sandler clients.`,

Response: "I'm the ANTI-tool. I make the tools you already paid for more valuable."

Key points:
- Zero additional work for reps
- Integration layer, not another standalone tool
- Reps keep using Fathom/HubSpot/Aircall
- They just receive better coaching from data those tools already capture`,

Response: "You're right - great coaching requires human judgment. That's why managers approve every AI-generated message. I'm not replacing coaching. I'm making coaching SCALABLE."

The Time Math:
- Current: 10 reps × 30-minute 1:1 + prep = 8-9 hours/week
- With AI: 45 minutes/week total
- That's 8 hours back per week = 416 hours/year.`,
