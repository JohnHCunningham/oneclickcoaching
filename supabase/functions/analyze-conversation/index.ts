ANALYZE USING SANDLER SELLING SYSTEM:

1. OPENING ANALYSIS
   - What they said: [quote]
   - Score: X/10
   - What worked: [specific elements]
   - Tactical improvement - Try these alternatives next time:
     * Option 1: "[exact script]"
     * Option 2: "[exact script with different angle]"
     * Option 3: "[negative reverse version]"
   - Sandler principle: [explain the rule being applied]

2. UP-FRONT CONTRACT
   - What they said: [quote or "not used"]
   - Score: X/10
   - Tactical script for next time:
     "Before we dive in, let me make sure this is worth your time. I'd like to ask you a few questions about [their pain]. At the end, you can tell me 'yes, let's move forward,' 'no, not a fit,' or 'let's talk later.' Fair enough?"
   - Alternative if they're skeptical:
     "I'm not sure if what we do is even relevant to you, but would it make sense to spend 10 minutes finding out? Worst case, we'll both know it's not a match."

3. BONDING & RAPPORT
   - What they did: [quote]
   - Score: X/10
   - Missed opportunities: [specific moments]
   - Tactical scripts to build rapport:
     * "How's your day going?" [PAUSE and listen]
     * "That sounds frustrating. Tell me more about that."
     * "I appreciate you being straight with me."
   - Mirroring technique: When they say "[their phrase]", echo it back: "So what I'm hearing is [their phrase]... is that right?"

4. PAIN FUNNEL - THE GOLD MINE
   - Questions they asked: [list with quotes]
   - Questions they MISSED: [critical gaps]
   - Score: X/10

   TACTICAL PAIN FUNNEL SEQUENCE (Use in this order):
   1. "Tell me about your current process for [their problem]..."
   2. "How long has this been going on?"
   3. "What have you tried to fix it?"
   4. "How much is this costing you?" [time, money, frustration]
   5. "What happens if you don't solve this?" [future pain]
   6. "Have you given up on fixing it, or are you still looking for solutions?"

   CRITICAL: After each answer, ask: "Tell me more about that" or "Can you give me an example?"

5. BUDGET DISCUSSION (NOT PRICE!)
   - What they said: [quote or "avoided"]
   - Score: X/10
   - Tactical scripts (Sandler rule: "Talk budget before talking price"):
     * "If I could show you a way to save 20 hours a week, what kind of investment would make sense for that?"
     * "Most housing providers in your situation invest between X and Y for a solution like this. Is that in the ballpark?"
     * "What budget have you set aside for solving this problem?"
   - If they deflect: "I understand you might not have exact numbers, but just to make sure we're not wasting each other's time - is this a $1,000 problem, a $10,000 problem, or somewhere in between?"

6. DECISION PROCESS
   - What they uncovered: [quote]
   - Score: X/10
   - Tactical scripts:
     * "Who else besides you would be involved in making this decision?"
     * "Walk me through how decisions like this typically get made at [Company]."
     * "What would stop this from moving forward, even if you love it?"
   - Red flag script: If they say "I need to talk to my boss":
     "I appreciate that. Help me understand - if this is perfect for you, what's the conversation you'll have with them? What questions will they ask that I should help you answer?"

7. TALK/LISTEN RATIO
   - Estimate: Rep talked X%, Prospect talked Y%
   - Target: 30% you / 70% them
   - Score: X/10
   - Tactical fix: After every statement, ask a question. After they answer, say: "Tell me more" or "What else?"

8. NEGATIVE REVERSE SELLING (Remove Pressure)
   - Used: Yes/No
   - Quote: [if used]
   - Score: X/10
   - Tactical scripts to remove pressure:
     * "I'm not sure if we're a fit, but would it make sense to explore that?"
     * "You might decide this isn't for you, and that's perfectly okay."
     * "I don't want you to buy anything today. I just want to see if this makes sense for you."
     * When they show interest: "What makes you say that?" (forces them to sell themselves)

9. OBJECTION HANDLING
   - Objections raised: [list with quotes]
   - How they handled: [quote]
   - Score: X/10

   TACTICAL OBJECTION RESPONSES:

   "I need to think about it"
   → "That's fair. What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the investment, the timing, or something else?"

   "Send me some information"
   → "Happy to. What specific information would be most helpful? And just so I don't waste your time, after you review it, what happens next?"

   "We don't have budget right now"
   → "I understand. Just curious - if budget weren't an issue, is this something you'd want to move forward with?" [Then deal with real objection]

   "I'm too busy"
   → "I get it. And that's exactly why I called - to potentially give you back 20 hours a week. If I could show you how in 15 minutes, would that be worth it?"
